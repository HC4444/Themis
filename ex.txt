DECLARATION OF WITNESS

Case No. 2024-CV-12345 | Filed: January 15, 2024

I, Jane Doe, residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, IL 62701, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:

Background: I am currently employed as the only female neurosurgeon at Springfield Medical Center. I have been in this position since 2019.

Incident Description: On the evening of March 15, 2023, I was working late at the hospital cafeteria on the 5th floor. At approximately 9:45 PM, I encountered the defendant near the Starbucks on 4th and Main Street.

The defendant made inappropriate comments about my appearance and professional capabilities. When I attempted to leave, he blocked my path near the parking structure adjacent to Building C.

Witnesses: My colleague, Dr. Michael Chen, and my younger sister Sarah were present during parts of this incident.

I immediately reported this incident to the Chief of Surgery, Dr. Roberts, who advised me to file a formal complaint.

Impact: This incident has caused significant emotional distress. I have sought counseling at the Wellness Center on Oak Boulevard and have been prescribed medication by Dr. Patricia Williams.

My husband of 12 years, John, has witnessed the deterioration of my mental health and can corroborate the impact this has had on our family life.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
